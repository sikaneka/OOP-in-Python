# ðŸš† Railway Management System  
*A Python + Streamlit project demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through a functional train booking system.*

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview  
This project is a **Railway Management System** that simulates basic train operations such as:  
- Viewing available trains  
- Booking tickets  
- Cancelling tickets  
- Viewing all booked tickets  

The project follows **OOP principles** and features a clean **Streamlit frontend** for interactivity.  
It is ideal for educational, demo, or beginner-level portfolio purposes.

âœ… View all available trains  
âœ… Book a ticket by entering passenger details  
âœ… Cancel an existing ticket  
âœ… View all booked and cancelled tickets  
âœ… Realistic seat management (available seats update dynamically)  
âœ… Fully modular structure using **Object-Oriented Programming**

## ðŸ§  Object-Oriented Concepts Used
| Concept | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Class & Object** | Defined classes for `Train`, `Passenger`, `Ticket`, and `RailwaySystem` |
| **Encapsulation** | Each class manages its own data and logic |
| **Composition** | `RailwaySystem` manages multiple `Train` and `Ticket` objects |
| **Abstraction** | Booking and cancellation logic hidden behind class methods |
| **Modularity** | Separate Python files for each class for clean project design |
